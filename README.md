# Virtual-Keyboard

Virtual Keyboard A Python-based virtual keyboard that uses hand detection and finger tracking to simulate keyboard input. This project leverages libraries such as OpenCV, Mediapipe, and pynput to create a touchless typing experience.

Features:

Hand Detection and Tracking: Utilizes Mediapipe to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
Virtual Key Presses: Maps hand gestures to virtual key presses using the pynput library.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the virtual keyboard.
Real-Time Performance: Ensures smooth and responsive performance for a seamless user experience.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
Mediapipe
pynput
time
